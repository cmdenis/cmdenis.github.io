          <p>Emergence is a concept that is not currently well-defined in science. There have been some philosophical discussions about what emergence is, with some very loosely qualitative definitions being proposed. These discussions have had very little predictive power, and from where I stand, have provided very little satisfaction for my thirst for answers about the topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            Emergence is loosely defined as the notion that systems at different scales behave drastically differently. The stereotypical example given is when we zoom out from atoms. These form molecules, which form organelles, which form cells, which form tissues, which form organs, which form organisms, which form communities, which form ecosystems, etc. All the different systems at all those scales have different properties and function quite differently from one another.
          </p>

          <p>Emergent phenomena are all around us, but a somewhat unifying understanding of how it all comes to be is lacking. How does one predict that a certain system will emerge from another? Given no prior knowledge about the living world, it would be extremely difficult to predict that life could have emerged from a bunch of elementary particles. Why do elementary particles give you life, whereas an infinite lattice of pure carbon does not?
          </p>

          <p>These are all questions pertaining to the idea of emergence.
