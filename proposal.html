          Dear BLUE Fellowship Committee,

          <p>
            My name is Christian, and I would like to apply to be an "official" BLUE scholar. In the following lines, I will outline the project that I will be undertaking within the program. Conversations and ideas are usually made up of little containers called words that refer to other ideas and conversations (similar to a Wikipedia page). In that spirit, I will be structuring this application in this manner. Hopefully, this clarifies some jargon used.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a physicist by training and am in the process of completing my Master's degree in physics at the University of Montreal. My work has been on this thing called the <a href="segmentation_clock.html">segmentation clock</a>. There are many avenues to explore with this system. The main characteristic of this model is that it is an oscillator (something that repeats itself over time, like a constant musical tone, for instance) model (see <a href = "genetic_networks.html">genetic networks</a>). More specifically, I have been working on a <a href="coarse_grained.html">coarse-grained</a> oscillator model. Experimentally, this coarse-graining meant looking at oscillations in the embryo's tissue that will give rise to the somites not on a cell-by-cell basis (because all cells individually act as oscillators) but globally in areas of cells. Concretely, the experiments were studying this thing called <a href="entrainment.html">entrainment</a>. By applying a succession of rhythmic pulses of a drug called DAPT to the tissue, my experimental collaborators (the Aulehla group, at the EMBL Heidelberg) could "entrain" the coarse-grained oscillator to the frequency of the pulses. To explain their experimental results, my supervisor and I developed a model featuring a "memory" variable that drastically changes how the system behaves, compared to classical entrainment models. We are very close to being done with the rough characterization of the system.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            A very natural question to arise from all this business is how does coarse-graining affect the system? A cascade of other questions then continue to pop up:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Could the memory that the system exhibits come from this coarse-graining itself?</li>
            <li>What are the properties of the somewhat arbitrary choice of scale that was chosen for coarse-graining?</li>
            <li>Is there a scale that makes more sense than another?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            All of these questions are very close to experiments and thus to the natural world (which, in my opinion, should be of much concern for physicists).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Tangentially to this project, I have been very curious and puzzled about the notion of <a href="emergence.html">emergence</a> in science. There are indeed a lot of cases where this notion of scale is called upon in fundamental physics (often presented in the context of statistical mechanics). One of the most basic ones is the renormalization of the <a href="ising_model.html">Ising model</a>. Recent work in neuroscience has examined the notion of emergence and linked it to causality (causal emergence). Causal emergence can be exemplified using some very simple toy models made up of interconnected binary gates. After coarse-graining them together into larger chunks (a process essentially identical in essence to the renormalization of the Ising model), we can observe that the new (macro) coarse-grained system behaves fundamentally differently than the initial underlying components (micro). In a way, the outcome is different from the renormalization procedure. In the classical renormalization case, we start with a micro-system with property A and once looking at the macro-system, we observe that it still preserves property A. In the "causal emergence case," the micro-system has property A, but after grouping things into the macro-system, it comes out with property B. This strongly suggests that the two systems are linked conceptually, and some sorting out of this business needs to be done from a scientific point of view.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            All of this being said, it seems like the world of coarse-grained biological oscillators is a good motivating example to explore this idea of emergence in a natural system. This project is exploratory by nature, but already possesses some solid biophysical evidence pointing towards interesting ultimate results.
          </p>

          <p>
            Exploration avenues could be:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Compute in a brute-force way different metrics stemming from causal emergence research for the biological system. These are essentially different measures of causality at different scales, and compare them to see which system is more causal. Should the macro-system present greater causality, this would already be a very important result on its own.</li>
            <li>Relate the observed memory variable to smaller plausible building blocks and numerically see if one can obtain an effective "global" effect as is already phenomenologically (in the physics sense) described.</li>
            <li>Recent work on the Ising model in a finite system has looked at mutual information between isolated populations of spins as a way to measure criticality. Firstly, presenting similarities and differences between 1) the framework for mutual information relating to criticality and 2) the framework for causal emergence could be of interest and rather novel. Secondly, in their work, they have presented very briefly some oscillatory dynamics occurring in the system. Hence, a possibility could be reproducing this dynamic and trying to find a link with the segmentation clock.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            In the present proposal, I hope to have explained somewhat clearly how ideas of emergence, biophysics, and statistical mechanics interconnect. It seems to me that we are at the cusp of truly connecting all of these into an "a-ha moment." The proposed project aims to contribute to efforts in that direction.
          </p>

          <p>I hope you consider my application,</p>
        
          
          <p>Christian Denis</p>

        </p>
