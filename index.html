        <p>Hello! <br>
            My name is Christian Denis and I am a canadian 
            physicist and artist. I am currently living in the wonderful city of 
            Montréal and am studying Honours Physics at McGill University. </p>

        <p>In physics I am mainly interested in theoretical reasearch, 
            but I appreciate elegant experiments. Paradoxically, I am very fond of 
            both extremely hands-on arts and crafts and of fundamental abstract ideas about math and physics. 
            I believe this has to do with the artistic quality these two seemingly opposite branches 
            have in common.</p>
            
        <p>I have also worked on multiple musical projects, involving studio albums 
            as well as various short film scores. I am always open to collaborate and 
            contribute to various artistic projects.</p>
            
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website!</p>
