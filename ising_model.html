          <p>
            The Ising model is ubiquitous in statistical mechanics because it is one of the few statistical models that feature "interesting stuff" that we can actually solve for analytically. The model describes a lattice of "spins" (you can think of spins as some sort of magnet that can point in one of two directions) that interact with each other. Historically, there was interest in understanding these kinds of models for the sake of understanding how magnetic metals work (which are, to some extent, big lattices of spins with more subtleties).
          </p>

          <p>The Ising model can exist in different dimensions.
          </p>

          <p>In 1D, you can think of it as just a line along which you have arrows that can point up or down, and, just like magnets, the nearby arrows might affect each other such that the system will "want" to be in certain configurations.
          </p>

          <p>In 2D, it is a grid with arrows either pointing in or out of the grid. Again, nearby "sites" (spots where there is an arrow) interact with themselves. I made a simulation of this system <a href="https://cmdenis.com/2D-Ising-Model/">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p>In 3D, the same thing, but imagine all the arrows being located inside a 3D lattice.
          </p>

          <p>One can extrapolate this idea to any dimension.
          </p>

          <p>One of the things we can do with this system is perform a "renormalization." This is sometimes called decimation. What it means is simply to group spins together. In 1D, this might mean:
          </p>

          <p>"OK, let's group the spins in pairs. So spins 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, etc. together and pretend that each of these new groups is actually only one singular new spin (in this new scale). How does the system behave under this transformation?"
          </p>

          <p>In 2D, a similar process can occur. One of the mysterious things with this whole thing is: How does the choice of grouping affect the outcome? The Ising model is a very simple model, and we could imagine that more complicated systems will have richer dynamics, and the choice of groupings will become even more non-trivial.
