# Note For Self: Thinking About That Random Walk Combinatorics

## Introduction

In sciences, we often have similar types of problems or structures that come back over and over again in all sorts of context. From a pretty basic point of view, solving an algebraic equation/system of equation is a problem that is constantly used in a variety of contexts. This is also the case of the eigenvector-eigenvalue problem that arrizes in quantum mechanics or in solving for the equation of motion of classically coupled oscillators, for amongst other places. You can also see a resemblance in the solving of an organic chemistry problem and the resolution of an integral: You start off with a certain form, and you want to end up with different form. You have at your disposition, a set of possible transformation you can apply to your integral or your molecule, and, going back and forth between the desired final state and the initial state you eventually find the right combination of tricks and transformation that will allow you to get to the desired form. So, the point is: seemingly different problems share structure.

In this post, I want to address the way that I think (and I'm certain that a lot of other people do the same) about the formulation of a combinatoric problem in the context of random walks. This problem can be
