            Humans start out their journey through life as a tiny cell. That cell then divides and divides until eventually a fully-formed organism is created.
          </p>

          <p>
            Q1: How is it then that we're not just a big, monstrous blob of cells?
          </p>

          <p>
            Well, as in a lot of things in science: the devil is in the detail.
          </p>

          <p>
            That single primordial cell is a pretty complicated machine. It interacts with its non-biological environment in ways that we still do not fully understand. Moreover, it interacts with other cells in even more complicated ways. Let me ask another question:
          </p>

          <p>
            Q2: How do cells even talk to each other?
          </p>

          <p>
            That is a field in which there is still a lot of research being done. Cells talk to each other through a variety of signaling pathways. One cell produces molecules in different quantities, and they are then received by other cells. This is one of the ways that cells roughly communicate with each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            Going back to Q1: The reason organisms don't develop into a blob is that they self-organize into a functional structure known as a human. This system has organs that work together to try to keep it "alive." In that very long process of self-organization, many mechanisms form all the parts of the organism. For vertebrate animals, a very important structure is the vertebrae. It has a particular structure that is repeating (think about how your spine is made up of roughly similar repeating units of bone: every vertebra is very similar to the next) and finite (it has a finite length).
          </p>

          <p>
            In the 70s, Zeeman and Cooke presented a model called the "clock and wavefront" model that offers a quantitative description of the development of the "somites." The somites can be thought of as the precursors of the vertebrae. They create a segmentation in the organism into a long chain of discrete blocks. The clock and wavefront model makes use of oscillators through <a href = "genetic_networks.html">genetic networks</a>, and the segmentation clock was born.
